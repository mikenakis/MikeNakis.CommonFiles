# Of Visual Studio, GitHub, README files, and symbolic links<br><sup><sub>Or, "how hard does 'world class software' suck."</sub></sup>

PEARL: GitHub requires the `README.md` file to be named `README.md`. This is a problem if you are aiming to give each file a different name, because a solution contains many projects, and each project needs its own `README.md` file. To work around this capriciousness of GitHub, we have to prefix the name of each `README.md` filename with the name of the project, and create a symbolic link called `README.md` which points to `<project-name>-README.md`. (Incidentally, this also makes it easier to locate it among editor tabs,) 

PEARL: Visual Studio suffers from another bug: it has no concept of symbolic links; the way it does file handling assumes that we live in a universe where symbolic links do not exist. Thus, Visual Studio is always under the impression that a symbolic link and a file pointed by the symbolic link are entirely different files. As a result, it is possible to open the `README.md` file twice in Visual Studio: once as `README.md` and once more as `<project-name>-README.md`. If you make changes to one of them, Visual Studio will not show these changes in the other, and if you make changes to both, and save them both, then the changes saved first will be lost, and only the changes saved last will take effect. Therefore, be careful: only edit `<project-name>-README.md`; never edit `README.md`.
