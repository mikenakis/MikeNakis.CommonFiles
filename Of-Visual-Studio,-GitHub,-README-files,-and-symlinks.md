# Of Visual Studio, GitHub, README files, and symlinks<br><sup><sub>Or, "how hard does 'world class software' suck."</sub></sup>

PEARL: Visual Studio suffers from a bug where the spell checker goes haywire every once in a while. When that happens, all your "excluded" words suddenly appear as spelling mistakes, and any words you try to "exclude" are not written into your "exclusion" file, they are written into some entirely irrelevant and useless `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\17.0_456b0cc0\exclusion.dic` file. The only way to recover from this haywire state is to restart Visual Studio. The spell checker seems to enter this haywire state at seemingly random moments, so it is extremely hard to find what causes the bug. I had to live with this bug for about a year until one day I realized that it happens if you have two files with the same name in the solution, and you open them both. To work around this bug, every single file in the entire solution must have a unique filename.

PEARL: GitHub requires the `README.md` file to be named `README.md`. This is a problem if you are aiming to give each file a different name, because a solution contains many projects, and each project needs its own `README.md` file. To work around this capriciousness of GitHub, we have to prefix the name of each `README.md` filename with the name of the project, (incidentally, this also makes it easier to locate it among editor tabs,) and create a symbolic link called `README.md` which points to `<project-name>-README.md`.

PEARL: Visual Studio suffers from another bug: it has no concept of symlinks; the way it does file handling assumes that we live in a universe where symlinks do not exist. Thus, Visual Studio is always under the impression that a symlink and a file pointed by the symlink are entirely different files. As a result, it is possible to open the	  `README.md` file twice in Visual Studio: once as `README.md` and once more as `<project-name>-README.md`. If you make changes to one of them, Visual Studio will not show these changes in the other, and if you make changes to both, and save them both, then the changes saved first will be lost, and only the changes saved last will take effect. Therefore, be careful: only edit `<project-name>-README.md`; never edit `README.md`.

All of the above apply equally to `LICENSE.md`.
